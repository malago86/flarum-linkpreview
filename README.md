Thanks to [Justoverclock](https://discuss.flarum.org/u/Justoverclock) for the idea!

**HELP WANTED**: The extension currently needs a token from a third party website and that service has limitations unless you pay for it. I am sure there is a way to do a small API point to do this within Flarum without having to rely on an external service. I could not find a way to do this myself but I am sure someone can help with this. If you want to collaborate, please contact me or feel free to fork the extension!

## Features
- Adds a card for links showing the title, description and icon.
- It needs a token from [www.linkpreview.net](https://www.linkpreview.net/)
